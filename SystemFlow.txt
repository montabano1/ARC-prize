System Operation Flow: ARC Challenge Solver with DSL Generation
1. Introduction

This document outlines the operational flow of an AI system designed to solve Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus (ARC) tasks by generating domain-specific languages (DSLs). The system leverages meta-learning, concept formation, pattern recognition, and curriculum learning to develop an adaptive and efficient problem-solving approach.
