PROJECT OVERVIEW
The Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus (ARC) challenge represents a fundamental AI problem: developing systems that can understand patterns and apply reasoning across diverse visual puzzles. This architecture outlines an AI system that generates domain-specific languages (DSLs) tailored for solving ARC tasks. The system combines meta-strategy selection, concept formation, pattern graph analysis, curriculum learning, and confidence-based feedback to create an intelligent, self-improving solution.
HIGH-LEVEL SOLUTION
The system implements a hybrid approach utilizing meta-level reasoning to select optimal problem-solving strategies, while forming and applying high-level concepts across tasks. It combines pattern analysis, evolutionary learning, constraint solving, and confidence-driven feedback to develop and refine DSLs for solving ARC puzzles. The system features dynamic strategy selection, concept formation, curriculum-based task progression, and adaptive complexity management.
